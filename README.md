# Topic Modeling using LDA

This project demonstrates **Topic Modeling** using the **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** algorithm on a small set of custom documents. It follows a complete NLP pipeline ‚Äî from text preprocessing to topic extraction and interpretation ‚Äî using Python in a Google Colab notebook.

The objective is to identify hidden thematic structures within a text corpus using an unsupervised learning approach. This project is ideal for beginners to understand the working of LDA with minimal dependencies and a hands-on example.
